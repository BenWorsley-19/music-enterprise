# Music Enterprise

The code here is structured and written so to provide An example of an enterprise-like codebase to showcase OO design 
and styles of tests for those who have not had much experience working in such codebases.

The context behind this code is:
You work for a very popular music streaming service. Your product manager wants to implement a "Quick Listens" 
feature to your service and so we need a system which gives us a list of tracks that we have are less than 2 minutes 
as well as their price and their genre.

The code here delivers this requirement though interacting with a MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

- java 17+
- gradle 7.2+
